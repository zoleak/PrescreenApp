# Overview
This R Shiny application streamlines the pre-screening process for my rental properties. Its core objective is to enable property managers to efficiently evaluate prospective tenants against essential rental prerequisites.

Through a user-friendly interface, managers collect vital applicant information, including personal, employment, credit, and rental history. Upon submission, the application processes data and generates a comprehensive summary of qualifications, accompanied by a prompt recommendation.

But this application offers more than just pre-screening. It empowers prospective tenants by enabling them to conveniently schedule property showings. Eligible applicants can select a showing time, which is then relayed to property managers via email. Moreover, all applicant data is seamlessly stored in a dedicated Google Sheet, streamlining analysis and decision-making.

In summary, this application equips property managers with informed tenant assessments, facilitates showing scheduling, and maintains an organized database. It ensures efficiency without compromising detail.
